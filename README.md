## Project description:

This phase is dedicated to text classification, with the primary objective of training a classification model capable of categorizing Persian news articles. The dataset comprises thirty thousand Persian news articles categorized into seven distinct classes. Your task involves the implementation of a service that can take a series of text inputs and accurately assign them to their respective classes using the models detailed below. The architectural overview of Phase 3 is depicted in the accompanying figure.

During this phase, you will develop a BERT-based model leveraging transformer models and the Hugging Face library. A selection of transformer models compatible with the Persian language can be found at the provided link. Your responsibility is to assess these models and choose the one that best suits your project's requirements.

Upon completion of this phase, you will present the performance metrics of your final model, including accuracy, F1 score, and the confusion matrix. Additionally, you will provide a code segment that offers a service capable of receiving a list of texts and determining the class to which each news article belongs.

## Result:
